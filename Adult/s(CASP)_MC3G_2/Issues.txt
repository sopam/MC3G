1) C3G
L0,L1 and L2
We have the cf state. We have the Norms.
We feed the cf state  to the path finding algorithm.
But the path will require more effort than the norm states
Divorced -> Separated: CF
Divorced -> Marriage -> Separated


2) P2C:

We find the path to cf state. 
We can only compute L0, maybe L1.
It takes too long
